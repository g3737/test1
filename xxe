That ranges from using GitHub to host the shared remote repository to working with colleagues and capitalizing on features like protected branches, code review, GitHub Actions, and more.</p><p>The best place to practice using Git and GitHub is the <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github">Introduction to GitHub Learning Lab course</a>.</p><p>If you already know Git and need to sign up for a GitHub account, head over to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/github/training-kit/blob/master/git-guides/git-overview.md">Contribute to this article</a> on GitHub.</p><h3>Get started with git and GitHub</h3><p>Review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 40 million developers.</p><h2>Site-wide Links</h2><a href="https://github.com/"></a> <h3>Subscribe to our developer newsletter</h3><p>Get tips, technical guides, and best practices.
